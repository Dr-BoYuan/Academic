This course exposes students to a wide range of database and data analysis topics which will be actively and practically explored by the students in order to prepare them for their future careers in large and small organisations. They will have opportunities to work with representative, real-world datasets to develop their understanding of the issues involved in managing and analysing the data and to explore the practical aspects of data mining and management data analysis and presentation using the SAS product set, including the Business Intelligence engine.

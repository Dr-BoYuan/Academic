I am a lecturer in computing and data science with the School of Computing and Engineering and a faculty member of the Data Science Research Centre (DSRC) at the University of Derby, U.K.

My research is at the forefront of fields in artificial intelligence, specifically in the context of applied machine learning techniques and business-oriented data science to help industrial organizations establish cost-effective IT infrastructures and build state-of-the-art AI solutions. My areas of expertise include but not limit to Applied Deep Learning, Industrial Internet of things, Data-driven Business Intelligence, and Cloud Architecture Design and Evaluation.
